# Janseva-DBMSProject

## Aim of the project

The JanSeva platform aims to democratize the search for the divine by enabling disabled, elderly,and physically unable individuals to reach pilgrimages. The platform combines the spiritual essence of pilgrimage with the convenience and accessibility of technology to provide an equal opportunity for all devotees to worship and receive blessings. This project has the potential to create employment opportunities in logistics and management, making it a potential startup idea. The platform can be used for all types of pilgrimages, and when scaled up, it can support the local economy and promote sustainable tourism. By incorporating advanced technologies, the platform can enhance user experience and provide personalized recommendations to users. The future scope of the JanSeva platform is vast, and it has the potential to become a game-changer in the religious tourism industry, promoting cultural exchange and spirituality.
